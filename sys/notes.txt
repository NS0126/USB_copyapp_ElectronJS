* Node file browser: https://github.com/sumitchawla/file-browser.git

* generating self-signed certificates:

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout cert/key.pem -out cert/cert.pem -days 3650

* make sure npm uses the right python for windows build:

npm config set python "`cygpath -w /cygdrive/c/Python27/python.exe`"

* Default app:
** The "default" app must be included as a subdir of the electron executable,
   and therefore needs to be duplicated for each platform.  This is
   just a thin redirect to the common resources directory (specified on the
   command line).
** This is also where the icon is defined.
** build with:

cd default_app ; asar pack  . ../default_app.asar
