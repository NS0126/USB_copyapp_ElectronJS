\section{Goal}

Provide a system whereby the client can place DRM protected content on
a USB drive, and end consumer can view but not easily copy the
content.  This replaces the need to, for example, place video content
on an encrypted DVD.  As such, the system needs to include both the 
encrypted content {\it and} the player.
