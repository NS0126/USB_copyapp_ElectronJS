\title{Design Specification \\ USB Content Player}

\section{Goal}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Phase I: Provide a system whereby the client can place DRM
protected content on a USB drive, and end consumer can view but not
easily copy the content.  This replaces the need to, for example,
place video content on an encrypted DVD.  As such, the system needs to
include both the encrypted content {\it and} the player.

\item Phase II: Provide an application that allows clients to manage
their own systems as stated in Phase I.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Account authentication
    \item License management.
    \item Generic “support” requests that forward to the client’s 
          technical contact details.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Phase III: Extend functionality to easily offer a facility to
include dynamic content or update content on the drive over an
internet connection.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Definitions}
Client / Client User - {\it Every USB}'s Customer/Client company.\\
End User - Client User's end users.\\
Content - Client Users' content to be secured.\\
Data - Client User's data that will not be secured.\\
Package - Encrypted Content\\
App - The USB Package player(s) and the Package.\\
Program - The software that prepares Apps.\\

\section{Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Work on Windows 7 or greater, and Mac OSX 10 or greater.
\item Support viewing of video using any support \verb+video.js+ format, 
with DRM enabled.
\item Support viewing of PDF files.
\item Support viewing of any image file renderable by the Chromium browser.
\item Prevent user from viewing content files outside of the 
player/viewer included in the device, or when the device is disconnected from 
the end user's computer.
\item Provide a content menu displayed through a Chromium embedded web browser.
\item Allow the end user to browse and view content files from within the
Chromium embedded web browser.  This browser is included as part of
the system, and is required to run on all supported operating
systems.\\
(see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework}).  
\item Should “attempt” to forward-prepare for additional phases.
\item Versioning and documentation is essential for understanding
future remote update rollout capability in existing versions already
in use by {\it Every USB}’s client’s end users.
\item Allow {\it Every USB} to batch load drives without user interaction.  That is,
the software must be configurable once, and then delivered as an image
to the production company to load on drives in batches up to 10,000 at
a time.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Design}

Files are presented securely by encrypting them once per individual file,
and then preventing copying at the player/viewer level.  This is demonstrated
in Figure \ref{fig:contentloop}.

\label{fig:contentloop}
\end{figure}

To accomplish this, the system has two main parts: the \verb+FILESYSTEM+ 
and the \verb+WEBAPP+, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mainmods}.

\subsection{Filesystem \& Encryption}
Single files are encrypted using a unique symetric AES cypher, using a
key generated based on a combination of the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item Masked device serial number (mask depends on batch size). 
\item Device firmware version
\item Global Salt (static, only changes with major versions)
\item Per-batch nonce.  \emph{This must be stored in the code in an
      obfuscated manner.}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Serial Number}: The serial number is masked based on the size of
the batch to be loaded.  For example, if a serial number is 32 bits,
and the batch size is 256 drives, then the mask would be \verb+0xffffff00+.
This means the key used for each one of the drives will be calculated
using the same input variables, and the encrypted data can remain
the same across all drives in the batch.

{\bf Key}: After it is calculated based on the variables above,
this key is stored in memory by the web server, and is used to decrypt
\verb+*.evusb+ files before serving them to the renderer.

An option for implementation is \verb+p3x-aes-folder+.

\subsection{Webapp}

The webapp is responsible for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Launching the web server when the device is attached to 
      a compatible computer.
\item Launching a browser (e.g. Chromium embedded), which will allow
      the end user to browse, view, and play content.
\item Decrypting content files
\item Displaying content files 
\end{itemize}

An option for implementation is \verb+electronJS+, which includes some 
integration with node and chromium embedded.

\subsection{Loader}

\section{Use Cases}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Loading Content
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Client provides content to {\it Every USB}.
    \item {\it Every USB} runs the {\bf Loader} to load the data.
    \item OPTION 1: The {\bf Loader} iterates through each attached
          (blank) USB drive, encryptes the data based on the device's nonce
          and serial number, and copies the data.
    \item OPTION 2: The {\bf Loader} generates an image suitable for
          loading during production time.  The serial number range and
          batch size must be known before production.  NOTE: Production
          is often done using a 3rd party production company.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Viewing Content
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item End user receives the USB drive (via postal mail, trade show 
          promotional material, or other means).
    \item End user inserts the drive into a compatible machine.  The 
          system will run automatically.  NOTE: this should not require
          any elevated priviledges to run.
    \item The system starts the web server, launches the viewer (chromium
          embedded), and presents the main menu.
    \item The end user selects content to view.
    \item If the end use opens the drive as a media storage device, and 
          copies a media file off of the drive, it is encrypted and not
          viewable using standard tools.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
